# 15$ Arduino MIDI Controller

![Image of the controller](img/front.jpg?raw=true)

I made mine as a gift in "reddit's" 2018 Secret Santa event. It's very basic and compact with just four knobs, but it makes mixing and recording automation data, such as filters and effects a lot easier.

The case was 3D printed and it's supposed to look like a cat, since my giftee mentioned beeing a cat-lover, so don't take it too serious. You can print whatever you like or you just buy/build a simple case.

## Code / Settings

In the Arduino *.ino file you can edit the pin connections, MIDI CC controller numbers, quantaty of poteniometers and more.

## Connections

Just an example on how to connect everything. I added a USB micro to USB B (panel mount jack) cable to the case for easier connection. If you have to wire the potentiometers in reverse for simplerer soldering, you can edit the orientation in the code.

## CAD file

I sketched up the case in Fusion 360. You can download it [here](https://a360.co/2FjdJOE)

## That's it..

A very simple project I mainly uploaded just for getting started with git and github.
